# Queens Problem Visualizer

## Overview

The Queens Problem Visualizer is a JavaFX application designed to animate and solve the N-Queens problem, a classic puzzle in which N queens must be placed on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal. Our visualizer not only finds solutions but also provides a step-by-step animation of the queens' movements, making it a valuable tool for educational purposes, algorithm enthusiasts, and those interested in problem-solving techniques.

## Features

- **Dynamic Board Size**: Users can specify the size of the chessboard, allowing for the visualization of different instances of the N-Queens problem.
- **Step-by-Step Animation**: Detailed animations show the process of placing queens on the board, including backtracking steps when a conflict is detected.
- **Interactive Interface**: Easy-to-use graphical user interface that allows users to control the visualization, such as starting, pausing, and resetting the animation.
